# Oscillations in Yeast Glycolysis

The model of oscillations in yeast glycolysis has become a standard test case for biochemical dynamics inference. The model consists of ODEs for the concentrations of 7 biochemical species:

One of the challange for modeling such a system is that it contains rational functions, that it, species concentrations appears in both dominators and numerators. Such expressions are usually derived from Michaelisâ€“Menten (MM) rate law. Good news is that MM rate law is derived from elemental reactions with Quasi-Steady State Asssumptions (QSSA). In another words, the system involves important species beyond the listed 7 species, and they are expressed as algebratic equations.

While CRNN is formulated based on the law of mass actions, mostly for elemental steps, we could incoorprate MM rate law into the structure in order to learn biochemical systems. Here we go the other way, Instead of learning the lumped reaction equations, we try to learn elemental steps by approaximating thsoe hidden species using another neural network.

This can be illustrated in the code
```Julia

node = ns_ - ns;
dudt2 = Chain(x -> x,
              Dense(ns, node, gelu),
              Dense(node, node, gelu),
              Dense(node, node, gelu),
              Dense(node, ns_ - ns, softplus));
pnn, re = Flux.destructure(dudt2);
rep = re(pnn);
p = vcat(pcrnn, pnn);

function crnn(du, u, pcrnn, t)
    u_ = vcat(u, rep(u))
    w_in_x = w_in' * @. log(clamp(u_, lb, ub))
    du .= (w_out * (@. exp(w_in_x + w_b)))[1:ns] .+ w_J
end

```

in which `u` is the 7 species, and `rep(u)` refers to the approximated hidden species.

We randomly generate 30 initial conditions following the work of Daniels and Nemenman 2015. They are spilt into training and validation datasets by the ratio of 20:10.

Further efforts will be directed to analyzing the learned CRNN weights and the dynamics of hidden species.

The most exiciting thing of this demo is that CRNN offers the flexibility to inference unknown unknown species, which is far beyond inferencing unknown species.
